# **Overview**

This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques, specifically Logistic Regression, to address the challenge of detecting phishing URLs. Phishing URLs pose a significant threat, and developing an accurate detection model is crucial for cybersecurity.

# **Key Components:**

### **Logistic Regression for Phishing Detection:**

The project employs the Logistic Regression algorithm as a classification model to identify whether a given URL is associated with phishing activities.
Logistic Regression is chosen for its effectiveness in binary classification tasks and its interpretability.

### **Hyperparameter Tuning for Improved Accuracy:**

To enhance the model's accuracy and performance, the project incorporates hyperparameter tuning.
The use of tools like GridSearchCV allows the exploration of different hyperparameter combinations, optimizing the Logistic Regression model for the specific characteristics of the phishing detection problem.

### **ROC Curve and AUC for Model Evaluation:**

Evaluation of the model's performance is done using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric.
ROC curves illustrate the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate at various probability thresholds.
AUC provides a single scalar value that summarizes the model's ability to distinguish between phishing and non-phishing URLs.

### **Purpose:**

The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust and accurate phishing URL detection system using Logistic Regression, leveraging hyperparameter tuning techniques to optimize model parameters. The inclusion of ROC curves and AUC as evaluation metrics ensures a comprehensive assessment of the model's discrimination capabilities.

By combining these elements, the project aims to contribute to the development of effective and efficient tools for identifying phishing URLs, thereby enhancing online security measures.
